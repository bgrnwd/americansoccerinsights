The ASI Summit is a soccer analytics conference that brings together researchers and analysts from professional teams, media outlets and universities. The agenda strikes a balance between presentations from those doing private work and those doing public work, as well as students showcasing their projects.

Students will have an opportunity to submit proposals for research projects using proprietary data.

**The 2025 ASI Summit, hosted by Rice University, will last a day and a half. We will begin on the afternoon of Friday, Jan 31, 2025, and run all day Saturday, Feb 1, 2025.**

The goals of the ASI Summit are:

1. to facilitate the exchange of ideas between leading thinkers in soccer analytics;
2. to bring together MLS and NWSL analytics staffers for face-to-face interactions;
3. to give students a platform on which to present their soccer analytics research;
4. and to promote the work of women in soccer analytics.
